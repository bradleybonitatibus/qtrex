# qtrex
Query template rendering and execution library written in Python.

The goal of `qtrex` is to provide a simple API that supports loading `.sql`
files that can be templated with `jinja`, and provide extensible configuration
options to either compile the files, and execute the rendered templates against
various databases.

## Getting Started

`qtrex` is installable at https://pypi.org/project/qtrex/ via `pip` using:

```
pip install qtrex
```
